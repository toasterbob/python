To start the app you just run this script. On OS X, Linux and Cygwin you
have to indicate that this is an executable file before you can run it:

$ chmod a+x run.py

Then the script can simply be executed as follows:

./run.py



add user

flask/bin/python
>>> from app import db, models

This brings our database and models into memory.
Let's create a new user:

>>> u = models.User(nickname='john', email='john@email.com')
>>> db.session.add(u)
>>> db.session.commit()

Changes to a database are done in the context of a session. Multiple
changes can be accumulated in a session and once all the changes have
been registered you can issue a single db.session.commit(), which writes
the changes atomically. If at any time while working on a session there
is an error, a call to db.session.rollback() will revert the database to
its state before the session was started. If neither commit nor rollback
are issued then the system by default will roll back the session. Sessions
guarantee that the database will never be left in an inconsistent state.

Let's add another user:
>>> u = models.User(nickname='susan', email='susan@email.com')
>>> db.session.add(u)
>>> db.session.commit()

Now we can query what our users are:
>>> users = models.User.query.all()
>>> users
[<User u'john'>, <User u'susan'>]
>>> for u in users:
...     print(u.id,u.nickname)
...
(1, u'john')
(2, u'susan')
theirs
1 john
2 susan
>>>

Here is another way to do queries. If we know the id of a user we can
find the data for that user as follows:

>>> u = models.User.query.get(1)
>>> u
<User u'john'>

Now let's add a blog post:
>>> import datetime
>>> u = models.User.query.get(1)
>>> p = models.Post(body='my first post!', timestamp=datetime.datetime.utcnow(), author=u)
>>> db.session.add(p)
>>> db.session.commit()

Here we set our timestamp in UTC time zone. All timestamps stored in our
database will be in UTC. We can have users from all over the world
writing posts and we need to use uniform time units.

You may have noticed that we have not set the user_id field of the Post
class. Instead, we are storing a User object inside the author field.
The author field is a virtual field that was added by Flask-SQLAlchemy
to help with relationships, we have defined the name of this field in the
backref argument to db.relationship in our model. With this information
the ORM layer will know how to complete the user_id for us.

To complete this session, let's look at a few more database queries that we can do:

# get all posts from a user
>>> u = models.User.query.get(1)
>>> u
<User u'john'>
>>> posts = u.posts.all()
>>> posts
[<Post u'my first post!'>]

# obtain author of each post
>>> for p in posts:
...     print(p.id,p.author.nickname,p.body)
...
1 john my first post!

# a user that has no posts
>>> u = models.User.query.get(2)
>>> u
<User u'susan'>
>>> u.posts.all()
[]

# get all users in reverse alphabetical order
>>> models.User.query.order_by('nickname desc').all()
[<User u'susan'>, <User u'john'>]
>>>
