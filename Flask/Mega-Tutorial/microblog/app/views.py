    # The g global is setup by Flask as a place to store and share data
    # during the life of a request. As I'm sure you guessed by now, we
    # will be storing the logged in user here.
    # The url_for function that we used in the redirect call is defined
    # by Flask as a clean way to obtain the URL for a given view function.

    # redirect('/index'), but there are very good reasons to let Flask
    # build URLs for you.

                           providers=app.config['OPENID_PROVIDERS']) #Here we grab the configuration by looking it up in app.config with its key.

# The validate_on_submit method does all the form processing work. If
# you call it when the form is being presented to the user (i.e. before
# the user got a chance to enter data on it) then it will return False,
# so in that case you know that you have to render the template.

# When validate_on_submit is called as part of a form submission request,
# it will gather all the data, run all the validators attached to fields,
# and if everything is all right it will return True, indicating that the
# data is valid and can be processed. This is your indication that this
# data is safe to incorporate into the application.

# If at least one field fails validation then the function will return
# False and that will cause the form to be rendered back to the user,
# and this will give the user a chance to correct any mistakes. We will
# see later how to show an error message when validation fails.

# The flash function is a quick way to show a message on the next page
# presented to the user. The flashed messages will not appear automatically
# in our page, our templates need to display the messages in a way that
# works for the site layout. We will add these messages to the base template,
# so that all our templates inherit this functionality.

# This view is actually pretty simple, it just returns a string, to be
# displayed on the client's web browser. The two route decorators above
# the function create the mappings from URLs / and /index to this function.

# Under the covers, the render_template function invokes the Jinja2
# templating engine that is part of the Flask framework. Jinja2
# substitutes {{...}} blocks with the corresponding values provided as
# template arguments.

# Control statements in templates

# The Jinja2 templates also support control statements, given inside
# {%...%} blocks. Let's add an if statement to our template
# (file app/templates/index.html):
  # <head>
  #   {% if title %}
  #   <title>{{ title }} - microblog</title>
  #   {% else %}
  #   <title>Welcome to microblog</title>
  #   {% endif %}
  # </head>
# Now our template is a bit smarter. If the view function forgets to
# define a page title then instead of showing an empty title the
# template will provide its own title.
