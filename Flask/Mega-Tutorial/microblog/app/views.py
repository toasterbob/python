# with before_request will run before the view function each time a request
# is received. So this is the right place to setup our g.user variable (file app/views.py):

# The current_user global is set by Flask-Login, so we just put a copy
# in the g object to have better access to it. With this, all requests
# will have access to the logged in user, even inside templates.

    # during the life of a request. As I'm sure you guessed by now, we
    # will be storing the logged in user here.

    # by Flask as a clean way to obtain the URL for a given view function.

    # redirect('/index'), but there are very good reasons to let Flask
    # build URLs for you.

# The validate_on_submit method does all the form processing work. If
# you call it when the form is being presented to the user (i.e. before
# the user got a chance to enter data on it) then it will return False,
# so in that case you know that you have to render the template.

# When validate_on_submit is called as part of a form submission request,
# it will gather all the data, run all the validators attached to fields,
# and if everything is all right it will return True, indicating that the
# data is valid and can be processed. This is your indication that this
# data is safe to incorporate into the application.

# If at least one field fails validation then the function will return
# False and that will cause the form to be rendered back to the user,
# and this will give the user a chance to correct any mistakes. We will
# see later how to show an error message when validation fails.

# The flash function is a quick way to show a message on the next page
# presented to the user. The flashed messages will not appear automatically
# in our page, our templates need to display the messages in a way that
# works for the site layout. We will add these messages to the base template,
# so that all our templates inherit this functionality.

# This view is actually pretty simple, it just returns a string, to be
# displayed on the client's web browser. The two route decorators above
# the function create the mappings from URLs / and /index to this function.

# Under the covers, the render_template function invokes the Jinja2
# templating engine that is part of the Flask framework. Jinja2
# substitutes {{...}} blocks with the corresponding values provided as
# template arguments.

# Control statements in templates

# The Jinja2 templates also support control statements, given inside
# {%...%} blocks. Let's add an if statement to our template
# (file app/templates/index.html):
  # <head>
  #   {% if title %}
  #   <title>{{ title }} - microblog</title>
  #   {% else %}
  #   <title>Welcome to microblog</title>
  #   {% endif %}
  # </head>
# Now our template is a bit smarter. If the view function forgets to
# define a page title then instead of showing an empty title the
# template will provide its own title.

# The @app.route decorator that we used to declare this view function
# looks a little bit different than the previous ones. In this case we
# have an argument in it, which is indicated as <nickname>. This translates
# into an argument of the same name added to the view function. When the
# client requests, say, URL /user/miguel the view function will be invoked
# with nickname set to 'miguel'.

# Once we have our user, we just send it in the render_template call,
# along with some fake posts. Note that in the user profile page we will
# be displaying only posts by this user, so our fake posts have the author
# field correctly set.
